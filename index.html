<br>"Interesting" facts about myself:<br>
<br><br>-I play guitar, which I taught myself and I own a disgusting amount of guitars. 
<br><br>-I also do music and audio production work for other artists, performing mixing and mastering to improve their music. 	
<br><br>-I once saw a chicken on the way to school. It ran past me and flew over several houses. That was the day I learned chickens are capable of short distance flight.
So basically, the movie chicken run is a lie. All the chickens could of just flown over the fence.

	<h2 align="center">Interest in IT</h2>

	<p> 

<br>My interest in IT first started when I was given a barely running computer when I was a child. Before that I had played games on my brothers’ computer
when it was not in use. My new(old) computer was just capable of playing the latest games but required incredibly frequent maintenance and modifications
to keep it running. I didn’t have the money at that age(and in 2008 computers were not as cheap as they are today!) to get it fixed so I had to learn
 about computers fast. My skills in IT are building and modifying computers and moderate skill in C++, python and java (and after this website guess we
 can throw HTML in there!). I also know all of Apples dirty secrets to make their laptops unrepairable so you have to pay a fortune or buy a new one(<i>for example, They cover
the back of their newer laptops batteries with a bonding agent to make swapping the battery out really difficult... it's not like its gonna fall out of the laptop is it?</i>). Did you know
that you can angle the laptop and dissolve the battery bonding agent out by submerging it in ethanol and replace the battery yourself for $50 rather than paying $600! for Apple to repair it?<br><br>

I choose to come to RMIT because after checking out Monash that place seemed like a nightmare. Also RMIT is next to the train station which is a huge plus. 
RMIT seems to be more practically minded compared to Melbourne or Monash which I consider the preferable method for learning programming and IT. I believe
 programming is one area where practice is most important and theory is supplimentry. Most other places I investigated for potential study seemed to have it
 the other way around.<br><br> 

I expect to learn the core skills required to become employed as a software developer. While I understand that IT and programming are ever evolving fields I
 hope to be able to be given a programming task and be able to effectively develop it to the requirements of client expectation. I expect to learn how to adapt
 quickly to any challenge set and that if I do not know the specifics of the task, to be able to draw upon the core knowledge learnt during my degree to be able
 to fill in the technical blanks and still deliver on expectations placed upon me. </p>

	<h2 align="center">Ideal Job</h2>
	<p>

<b>An ideal job would be a VST(plugins) and DAW (Virtual Studio Technology, DIGITAL AUDIO WORKSTATION) Developer.</b> <br><br> https://www.ableton.com/en/jobs/apply/85991/<br><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="C:\Users\matthew\Desktop\job1.jpg" alt="job 1" align="middle"></p><br><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="C:\Users\matthew\Desktop\job2.jpg" alt="job 2 align="middle"></p><br><br>

In this role I would be creating and testing software designed to emulate the equivalent of real-world recording and production studio technology.
 I have my own studio and equipment as well as a large library of VSTs. With years of interest and practice in musical technology, it would be a
 given that this area of IT and software would be of interest to me. Working in a role such as this would allow me to merge IT with another area 
of interest of mine(music creation, capture and manipulation) and allow the two to not only bounce off each other but to maintain an interest in 
more classical programming through integration with more creative thinking and technology.<br><br>

The skills required in this area are not incredibly broad but do fall under two vastly different schools of thought. The first being the "IT and programming" 
school. This would encapsulate skills such as Excellent C/C++ coding skills. C++ and C are the go-to languages for VST development. The execution speed of this
 language makes it really the only language that can work with audio in real time. Experience designing and implementing procedural audio software is
 a must in this area. There is no room for latency when using VST technology. Understanding of Swift and Objective-C are necessary, as most VSTs are 
expected to work on both Apple and Windows products. I would also have to have experience with coding DAW software. <br><br>

The Second "school of thought" would be the actual hardware we are attempting to replicate using software. This would be understanding of audio, acoustics,
 physics, and procedural audio. This would include understanding not only how the hardware works but what it is actually trying to accomplish. It's one thing 
to understand that a compressor reduces audio signals above a threshold but is another to understand why/how you would want to do it in an audio mix. There are
 no right ways of doing things in audio but plenty of wrong ways is another way of saying it. I would have to be able to understand what a plugin is trying to 
accomplish acoustically or signal wise and then be able to translate its purpose into code. <br><br>

I would have to have a good understanding of acoustical theory and how we can alter audio files using signal processors. 
A bachelor in something such as BCH IT( software development) or software engineering would be highly appropriate though not required as examples 
of previous work is most important(seeing as you can develop working VSTs independently).<br><br>

And finally, good User-centred Design is critical as a good interface for a plugin can make or break it on the market. <br><br>

Currently I have the eqivalent of say a start of second year uni programmer with  C++. I have a good understanding of the major and most lesser
 known signal processors(compressors, EQs, limiters, saturators, harmonic exciters etc etc.) and how/where to apply them. I also have good knowledge 
on the use of some DAW programs. I have done post production work using this type of equipment on multiple projects for other artists and understand
 the requirements of any producer who would be using this software. <br><br>

Most of the further required skills centralise around the software side. My understanding of the audio side is already at the minimum for this position.
 Primarily the degree in IT with a major in software development would be a great help towards getting the experience I need to obtain this position. However
 this would have to be supplimented with the extra activites such as the development of independent crowd source created plugins to develop the neceassary experience
 required for this position. I would have to start with developing more simple plugins (such as monophonic* sythesisers and basic compressors) and work towards 
eventually developing more complex plugins. This would not only gain me much-needed experience but would also facilitate the creation of a folio of plugins I would have created.<br><br> 

to summarise this plan I would:<br><br>

1. Finish my degree at RMIT, while<br>
2. develop simpler plugins, then<br>
3. develop more complex plugins<br>
4. expand and publish my folio for use and advertisement<br>
5. apply for positions once I have made professional grade plugins. <br><br><br>

<i>*Polyphony is a property of musical instruments that means that they can play multiple independent melody lines simultaneously. Instruments
 featuring polyphony are said to be polyphonic. Instruments that are not capable of polyphony are monophonic or paraphonic.-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony_and_monophony_in_instruments</i>

	<h3 align="center">TEST RESULTS</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="birdman769.github.io/Test1.jpg" alt="Test" align="middle"></p> <br><br>

	<p><b>TEAMWORK AND ROLE TEST</b></p><br><br>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="C:\Users\matthew\Desktop\explorer1.jpg" alt="learn" align="middle"></p> <br><br>
	<p>The results of these tests are not of extreme revelations to me. I think the potential learning of ones self in these tests might be better suited to my classmates
 who are largely fresh out of high school and still developing their interpersonal skills, and ability to overcome the fear of public speaking to answer questions in front of
 the class. I did learn that my "personality type" is called "The Debater" . Which  in this overly sensitive world some people might also call "the A**hole"(though if so, I'd 
argue more than 3% of the population fall into this catagory). Although apparently it is in my nature to poke holes in everything and argue against the point for the sake of it
 and be insensitive, so why take anything I say seriously? After all, a computer test basically just called me a stone throw from a sociopath :) <br><br>

In regards to behaviour in a team. I should always watch what I say because a debator is quite known for offending people alot. Apparently, the truth upsets people. I would also
 have to be more commited to getting involved with the "grind" because debators are quite good at brainstorming and masterminding but lose enthusiasm for execution. I would have
 to commit more effort to the earlier stages of the project before my enthusiasm waivers. <br><br>

When forming a team I should keep in mind the results of these tests and avoid people who try to sit back and let everyone else do the work. Because it will probably upset them
 when I call them a ****  for being the worst thing on the planet. I should try to form a team with people who are logical and aren't afraid to have their ideas picked apart or 
to do the same to me. Cause apparently I get off on that. If I am a "Explorer" as my team role test suggests, I should be quite capable of handling a team that might otherwise
 suffer from a lack of communication due to introvertism as I don't mind talking to other people and in front of other people.<br><br>

As this quote so wonderfully captures <i>"An odd juxtaposition arises with Debaters, as they are uncompromisingly honest, but will argue tirelessly for something they don’t actually
 believe in, stepping into another’s shoes to argue a truth from another perspective."</i><br><br>

and the next time someone tells me I'm a prick, I'll just tell them I'm "uncompromisingly honest".<br><br> </p>
